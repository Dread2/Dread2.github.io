### CPSC 120 

* Lab 8 

    Lab 8, part 1 was a favorite because of the word processing. I had known how to iterate over certain objects however it was the first time that I learned to iterate over a string. It would end up being helpful for the eventual use of .end() and .begin() in vectors and arrays. 

* Lab 10 
    
    Lab 10, part 1 was a favorite because of the use of .h files. While I had known about .h files, I did not know they can be used as areas to store seperate functions. Now I have started integrating .h files into all my side projects such as a windows repair tool. 

* Lab 12 

    Lab 12, part 1  was a favorite because of the beauty of RGB. I had always wondered how R.G.B. could be integrated into code as clean and efficient functions. It was the first time using ImageMagick to create a beautiful animation. I was able to work out how to use ImageMagick in my other personal objects, like displaying a rainbow. 
    
    Lab 12, part 2 was a favorite because of the math and understanding of RNG. I was always wondering about the applications of RNG and the reliability of typical random number generators. It was the first time I had learned about the specific reliability of generators such as srand().
